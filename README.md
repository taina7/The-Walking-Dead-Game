The post-apocalyptic universe of The Walking Dead is the setting for the narratively-driven survival horror game The Walking Dead: Last Refuge. In a world overrun by undead, players assume the role of a survivor fighting to keep a small group of people safe. Every decision has an effect on the plot, interactions among individuals, and group fate.
